    <p>New site, who dis?</p>
    <p>
      I decided to rebuild my website from scratch. 
      This time without using an SSG or any other kind of framework. 
      Just some plain HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of JavaScript (web-components) to make posting a little easier.
      I don't really feel like bringing all the old content over from my previous sites, so it's probably going to be pretty empty for a while.
